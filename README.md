# Iris Identification Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that implements a robust iris recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Features

- **Iris Segmentation & Matching:** Uses CNNs for accurate iris detection and recognition.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Supports live iris identification.
- **Robust Performance:** Handles variations in image quality and ambient conditions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-identification.git
   cd iris-identification
   ```

2. **Set Up the Python Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
   - (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Dependencies typically include TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, etc.*

## Deployment

### Local Deployment

- **Run the Application Locally:**
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
- This will start the application on your local machine for testing.

### Production Deployment

- **Using Docker:**
  1. **Build the Docker Image:**
     ```bash
     docker build -t iris-identification .
     ```
  2. **Run the Container:**
     ```bash
     docker run -d -p 5000:5000 iris-identification
     ```
  - Replace `5000:5000` with your preferred host and container ports.

- **On Cloud/Server:**
  - Deploy using platforms that support Python applications (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or any virtual private server).
  - Make sure to configure the necessary environment variables and security settings.

## Use Cases

- **Access Control:** Secure physical or digital access using biometric iris recognition.
- **Attendance Systems:** Automated biometric attendance for institutions.
- **Border Security:** Enhanced identity verification at border checkpoints.
- **Personalized Authentication:** Integration into mobile or desktop applications for secure user authentication.
